The World Health Organization estimates it would take $24.7 billion to close the gap for unaddressed refractive errors and cataracts globally.
Poor vision is a major public health problem in Vietnam for school-going children. Over 3 million school children have a visual impairment, and they face challenges in accessing high quality services and assistive technologies. In Vietnam, prevalence of uncorrected refractive error among urban school children aged 6â15 years is 25â40%, which is one of the highest in the world. Of those who have uncorrected refractive error, only 33% of them have access to a pair of spectacles, which 60% of the time is likely an incorrect prescription. Key drivers included the lack of consideration of eye health in prior school health policy frameworks, the lack of guidelines for implementing vision screening during annual school health check-ups for children, poor awareness of the importance of eye health among teachers, and the lack of training resources for school nurses and teachers to provide eye health services and referrals.

Current supply of school canteen by government covers only 18 school days out of 120 days in total. Challenges include insufficient budget to cover the operation of the project, food shortages in the canteens, irregular operation of the canteens, low community involvement, lack of staff to manage the canteens, ineffective model for the sustainability of the canteens, etc. Proposed project seeks to address these challenges by introducing sustainable, well-stocked canteens for all 120 school days.","The project aims to reduce child labour in cocoa producing regions in Cote d'Ivoire.

Over a million children aged 3â5 lack access to ECD services, with urban areas experiencing supply shortages and rural areas struggling with low demand. Quality varies widely, as many ELPs lack resources, training, and effective performance monitoring. Developmental outcomes are low, with nearly half of children in ELPs falling short of key milestones, and socio-economic disparities further exacerbating these issues. Additionally, many ELPs are unregistered, limiting their access to government subsidies needed for sustainability.

To address these challenges, the Department of Basic Education (DBE) and the Education Outcomes Fund (EOF) are developing a programme focused on improving access, quality, and developmental outcomes. This approach incorporates extensive stakeholder input, innovative tools for quality assurance, and measures to streamline subsidy access, aiming to achieve universal access to quality ECD by 2030.",source1,,,,,,,Yes,,,source1,,,,,,,,Yes,source1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Many age-eligible children have no or limited access to ECD services. Currently, over one million children in South Africa between the ages of 3-5 have no or limited access to ECD services. The cause of the perceived access gap differs across geographies; in densely populated urban areas, there are an abundance of age-eligible children in demand of early learning programmes but a limited number of early learning programmes. As such, access gap in such areas stems mostly from shortage in the supply of ELPs. In rural areas where there is abundant land but few age-eligible children, access gap can often be attributed to a lack of demand. 

2. Quality of existing early learning programmes is highly variable. There is not yet an established, reliable assessment system for the quality of early learning programmes. Depending on the socio-economic contexts they operate in, ELPs vary in their abilities to access ancillary support, such as resources for practitioner and management training. ELPs also differ in their abilities to conduct systemic performance monitoring and tailor services to meet the diverse demands of children participating in the programme. 

3. Child development outcomes in existing early learning programmes are low. The 2022 Thrive by Five Index Report, for instance, showed that only 45% of children enrolled in an ELP in South Africa are on developmentally on track for both physical growth and early learning. 53% of all children are falling short of at least one of the developmental milestones for their age and are deemed at risk. 4% of all children face significant barriers to meeting developmental milestones in both physical growth and early learning and are deemed at high risk. 

4. Early learning programmes face barriers to accessing the government subsidy, which is key to ensuring sustainability of the service delivered and outcomes achieved. The 2021 ECD census showed that 60% of centre-based ELPs are not registered. To meet this challenge, DBE is working to streamline the registration framework and process to make it easier and more straightforward for ELPs to register and receive the subsidy. ","The primary objectives of this programme is to expand access to and improve quality of ELPs in disadvantaged communities to ultimately improve child development outcomes. To achieve these objectives, the programme will contract Resource and Training Organizations (RTOs)  to help establish new, high-quality ELPs and support existing ones with training, registration, and additional resources. By doing so, the programme will complement and strengthen DBE's ongoing efforts to build system capacity and expand quality access to ECD services.",,Yes,,,,,,,,,Yes,,4,,,,source1,,"Children aged 0-5 enrolled in low-fee, full-time ELPs","Initial calculations suggest the programme can reach around 100,000 total children in about 1,500 new and existing ELPs over 3 years.

Additionally, the novel solution of using the ITMOs mechanism to finance privately delivered climate projects by non-state providers needs validation. Accelerator support can be instrumental in overcoming these pain points by providing expertise in legal and administrative design, facilitating demonstrations to build confidence in digital technologies, and assisting in piloting the innovative ITMOs mechanism. This targeted assistance can catalyze the project's progress, breaking through critical barriers and fostering innovative climate solutions.",source1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The development challenge centers on the lack of efficient and transparent mechanisms to finance and implement climate impact mitigation interventions in developing regions. Market failures contributing to this challenge include the absence of reliable data for measuring and verifying emission reductions, limited access to capital for innovative climate projects, and a lack of incentives for private investment in sustainable development. Traditional financing models often fall short in addressing the unique needs of climate projects, leading to underinvestment and slow progress. The program aims to overcome these barriers by leveraging the ITMOS mechanism under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, utilizing digital measurement, reporting, and verification (dMRV), and outcome-based financing (OBF). Using already available technology, the program seeks to mobilize private capital, ensure high-integrity data, and create a scalable model for climate action.","Innovations in the digitization of carbon markets could transform how green technology infrastructure, such as modern energy cookstoves, gets financed and scaled up in Africa. These mechanisms leverage Climate Finance to promote financial inclusion and stimulate sustainable local socio-economic development, by distributing incentives and providing direct digital cash transfers to local implementing agents and beneficiaries using the green technologies. Digital transformation also creates opportunities to mobilize and equip digitally-native youth with skills, tools and incentives, which could provide the workforce and promote entrepreneurship for the green economic transition in Africa. The UNICEF-led Youth Opportunities Marketplace (Yoma) is gearing up to provide the digital coordination and financing platform aiming to create new income opportunities for youth in the transition to a green economy. Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) are a key driver of this financing innovation. National governments in Africa have begun to introduce regulations that allow mitigation activities to be funded through ITMOs under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement. As an example, the government of Zambia has authorized the design of a national modern energy cooking mitigation activity that implements digital Measurement, Reporting and Verification (dMRV) to certify Mitigation Outcomes and Carbon Credits. Government-sanctioned Mitigation Outcome Purchase Agreements (MOPAs) between the Mitigation Activity (MA) implementers and counterparty government Acquiring Parties are expected to raise the bar for the quality, price, and predictability of the supply for Mitigation Outcomes â including for carbon credits in the Voluntary Carbon Markets. This should significantly reduce financing risks for private capital to invest in green energy infrastructure projects. Digital MRV provides real-time visibility of MA project performance, which could reduce project execution risks. Generating digitally certified outcomes could increase capital velocity and liquidity in carbon credit markets. Project finance may now be structured using innovative financing instruments that are linked to the proceeds of MOPAs and to forward contracts for digitally certified ITMOs and Carbon Credits in the private sector. This model of Outcome-based Financing presents a promising approach that could be extended to other areas of sustainable development, such as healthcare and education, potentially transforming funding mechanisms in these sectors and providing opportunities for youth.",No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,,"5,7,13",,,,,,,,,,No,Yes,No,No,source1,,Data for this pipeline project was last updated in May 2024.,Zambia,ZM

The technology of EV charging infrastructure, together with the OBF solution that we are looking to launch are significant innovations that will deliver the scale of transition necessary to have a significant impact on East Africa's NDC. Once delivered in Kenya, the model will have demonstrated it is commercially viable i.e. outcomes delivered, finance received, and repayment model demonstrated.

Given the nascent stage of the sectors growth, the funding approach is following the same pattern as the household solar sector, with equity and short-term asset financing mechanisms the main source of capital. 

What separates the EV sector from household solar is the dependency on an expansive charging network to ensure mass adoption. Such infrastructure is typically financed using longer term, cheaper debt and financiers require a certain level of certainty of repayment. This requires complex modelling. Without early-stage design funding, developing a commercially credible investment case will be challenging, meaning that transition will rely on individual operators attracting investment for their individual plans, inhibiting the speed of transition necessary to support Kenya (and the regions) NDCs.",source1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""The mass adoption of 2-wheeler EVs is being restricted by the reach and scale of a suitable charging infrastructure.

Exceptional execution is preventing great ideas from solving some of the world's biggest problems.

Smaller organisations can be wary of bringing in support, especially from established consultants. Consultancy is perceived as expensive without guaranteed results. Consultants will have to move onto next project at some point and are generally paid for advice, not to deliver the solution. Resource constrained organisations often do not feel they can take that risk. Payment by results mitigates that risk.

Some progressive impact investors are bringing in external support for organisations, but challenges still exist. Picanto's partners are people that have run charities and social businesses in LIMCs. They have lived through the challenges they are helping to solve.

Impact investors are discussing a lack of diversity in investees and recognise that this sort of support may mitigate some of the risks in stepping away from their normal founder profile.""","""A group of social entrepreneurs/intrapreneurs were looking back over their past decade in the industry and recognised that many ideas with huge potential for impact failed due to poor execution.

Offering world class execution support to mission driven organisations can lead to the scaling of great interventions, whose impact may have otherwise been lost. This support is about operationalising strategy, building upon existing traction and good understanding of an issue. For example, helping a doctor with a fantastic solution to develop and execute a marketing plan.

Support is delivered as partnership, with the explicit objective that the work will continue without Picanto, generally with new roles created. The pay by results model means that resource constrained organisations can get access to support they might not otherwise get and also that Picanto is incentivised to ensure a lasting, impactful outcome that continues to add value.

Jackfruit's average loan size is $25,000, with an average school educating 376 students. Instill Education's programming typically costs $30 per month per school. If the average interest reduction equates to 1% of loan value, this means that for a two year intervention the total cost of the intervention is $970, or <$3 per student.

At present, while 71% of GCF accredited entities are from LMICs, they only receive 13.1% of GCF funding, a gap that reflects the scarce capacity that many of these entities have to meet the high standards of GCF's funding approval processes and criteria, such as cost-effectiveness. By providing the ability of OBF to guarantee GCF cost-effectiveness by ensuring all funding is only disbursed for results, this project has the potential to provide a test case to enlarge the application of this model, enabling GCF and other donors to scale up their funding for LMIC partners and programs.",source1,,"While there is substantial funding available to pay for climate programs, progress is constrained by a lack of funding available for the necessary structuring and design required to develop rigorous programs that meet GCF's high standards.",source1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The challenges of climate change represent a classic and clear-cut market failure: the harmful effects of activities that emit or release carbon dioxide represent unpriced negative externalities causing them to exceed their socially desirable levels, ultimately driving the present climate crisis. At the same time, the lack of pricing of activities that reduce or absorb carbon dioxide emissions and other GHG emissions drives their underprovision of resources to be properly funded. Responding to these needs, global actors have established various mechanisms and funds, like the GCF, aimed at reducing or removing emissions. In this context, it is critical that we identify cost-effective programs that can respond to this market failure (such as Protected Areas) and effective funding modalities (such as Outomes-Based Financing (OBF)) which can drive effective programming. ","High-Income Countries have pledged USD 100 billion to respond to the climate crisis through mitigation and adaptation spending to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). While there is a long way to go in securing all these resources, questions of the efficacy as well as the quantity of spending are of increasing importance given a concerning lack of evidence on the effectiveness of significant parts of climate spending and the widely diverging results found from the little evidence we have. Additionally, vulnerable countries that need climate finance the most are often the least likely to receive it given capacity gaps. This situation is slowing the globe's response to the climate crisis and depriving LMICs of critically needed for adaptation to preserve development gains. 
In this context, Instiglio has developed a partnership with KenyaÃ¢ÂÂs National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) to prepare highly cost-effective mitigation and adaptation programs that would entail RBF payments linked to climate results and be funded by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and other partners.

Many young adults lack essential financial knowledge, hindering them from making informed decisions about their finances, careers, or potential entrepreneurial pursuits. This lack of understanding not only stifles their personal growth but also deprives the economy of an empowered workforce and entrepreneurial potential.

Furthermore, the inability to navigate financial intricacies can create barriers to entry for budding entrepreneurs. These barriers deter many from actualizing their business ideas, subsequently limiting economic dynamism and innovation. When young minds are deterred from entrepreneurial endeavours, the broader economy loses out on potential innovations.

Lastly, the ripple effect of individual financial mismanagement can lead to larger economic inefficiencies and further perpetuate income inequalities. Those equipped with financial skills can grow their wealth, while others remain stagnant, exacerbating socio-economic disparities. Addressing this literacy gap is essential for a more balanced and prosperous Nigeria.","Despite its abundant resources and talent, Nigeria trails behind many countries in terms of equality and social mobility, with the gap continuing to expand.

1. Risk Mitigation and increased capital allocation: Considering the credibility gap that informal workers encounter in accessing formal credit, the introduction of credit guarantees by the Platform mitigates associated risks with its concessional capital.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, employment in the informal economy saw a significant increase. In 2021, 76% of workers in rural areas and 65% in urban areas were employed in informal non-agricultural sectors.

Informal workers are confined in a low-skill low-productivity trap, with limited opportunities to train or upskill themselves. They are highly susceptible to exploitative practices, abuse, and conditions akin to forced labor, and lack adequate social protection.

Since these individuals lack any formal documentation of gainful employment, formal credit avenues are inaccessible for them. As a result, many within the informal sector resort to acquiring loans from unregulated entities, which typically charge exorbitant interest rates. Such engagements with the informal credit market can inadvertently ensnare workers in crippling debt traps, at times leading to bonded labor situations.","Dignity in Labour platform is a multi-stakeholder blended finance facility that will connect vulnerable, new-to-credit customer groups to suitable lending partners and enable access to relevant government social security programs for all workers that interact with the facility.

However, these roles still require certain skills and a stable living situation, which many homeless individuals lack. The initiative aims to correct this inefficiency by providing skill training, vital services, and personalized support. By equipping the homeless with both hard and soft skills tailored to the local job market, and by fostering collaborations with local businesses, the program seeks to bridge the gap between the homeless and employment, addressing both the symptom and the root cause of the issue, benefiting not just the homeless, but also the communities in which they live.","Durban has been grappling with homelessness for many years. Covid made it worse. In June 2022, more than 16 000 homeless were found across eThekwini, of which approx. 5000 were in the inner-city.

2. The recent prioritisation of ECCE by the Ministry of Basic and Senior Secondary Education (MBSSE) also means that several of the administrative and institutional structures needed to support the rapid expansion of the sector are still in development. Firstly, there is limited data, especially on quality of ECCE provision and on the functioning of the more informal parts of the ECCE sector such as community ECD centres. Limited oversight and monitoring of ECD centres have resulted in an incomplete picture of the ECCE provision. In turn, this leads to an absence of evidence to inform policy, particularly on informal provision and its quality. Finally, as the sector develops, interventions have been more focused on activities/inputs and outputs rather than on outcomes, such as child development. In following the GoSL existing commitment to impact, it will be critical moving forward that accountability structures focus on impact on child development to ensure that existing efforts are translated into improved outcomes for children.
3. Process and structural quality are limited due to infrastructure constraints and insufficient pedagogy rollout. There is a limited use of age-appropriate pedagogy as the new standards have not been translated into practice yet. Some pre-primary centres lack basic facilities: for example, 24% of pre-primary centres had no access to running water in 2021, and most teachers are not trained in using child-centred approaches. These structural constraints combine to create a situation of insufficient supply of ECCE services. Additionally, there is a limited use of age-appropriate pedagogy as the new standards have not been translated into practice yet. A lack of capacity to systemically monitor the process quality of these centres also limits the information available on their suitability to meet instructional quality standards. There are also demand-side forces that impact the rollout of process quality improvements, such as limited parental awareness of the importance of ECCE and age-appropriate and play-based pedagogies for childrenâs holistic development and learning, which leads to limited demand for these programmes in some areas","The primary objective of this programme is to expand access to quality early learning opportunities to achieve the ultimate goal of improving holistic child development outcomes for children aged 3-5 in Sierra Leone to better prepare them for the next stage of education. This programme aims to complement existing programmes, such as the proposed GPE funding which aims to expand the pre-primary sector through establishing P0 classrooms within primary schools with UNICEF acting as grant agent.

As the name reflects, accelerating this process mainly the planning and designing, will help the project timeline.""",source1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""The main challenge is to start as soon as possible, considering that the development of employability skills or strengthening local business will not be a quick task and we will need to have enough time for them to be ready. 
The second challenge is the government involvement, considering that next year (2024) there will be elections of federal, state and local governments and the new administrations will take office until December of 2024. That will only leave 18 months until the world cup and we don't believe having decent work, promoting a fair and equal world cup for local business nor sustainable lenses for the event. 
The informal business and other power structures that will jump right into the opportunity. ""","""We have a clear opportunity ahead in Mexico: FIFA's World Cup 2026.
We know what and when is going to happen, understanding that, only for Mexico, represents a 1 billion USD of money flow into the country. But most of this economic opportunity is going to be taken by global brands and companies. In other hand, Mexico suffers of high informality rates and bootleg and low cost products mainly from China. So this opportunity, to leverage the world cup investment to have a real impact, it can fade away easily. 
So our project aim to take advantage of the economic benefits of the World Cup in Mexico 2026 to create social impact throughout social mobility, wealth distribution and decent work:
We will achieve this with the following actions:
Develop employability for young people for them to obtain a decent job during the world cup.
Strengthening of local businesses in neighborhoods surrounding the stadiums, shopping centers and tourist centers of the World Cup venues to maximize their sales.
Activate businesses led by youth from vulnerable communities. 
This is a once or twice life opportunity, and we have 3 years to create the scenario to promote a fair and equal world cup.""",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,,"8,10",,,,source1,,,,,,No,No,Yes,No,source1,,Data for this pipeline project was last updated in August 2023,Mexico ,MX

The innovative model is represented by two worlds blended together -- 1991 Accelerator with local ecosystem and government partners located in Kyiv will be bridged with 1991 Ventures fund located in London with partners representing the City of London's capital. Altogether this will have a powerful synergetic effect. 1991 Ventures will be sustainable as he fundraising will be complete and the structure of management fees will keep the fund self-sustainable for at least 10 years and will keep the impact-focus for the entire lifespan of the fund. ,source1,,"1991 Accelerator was always focusing on startups that make life better -- united donor blood centres, inclusive transportation, AI to spot fake news. But this was never structured to comply with impact frameworks and existing standards that are appreciated by investors. Currently as we're at the edge of launching a fund to invest into impact tech startups, we need to develop and establish an ecosystem of startup and investment criteria, evaluation process, impact progress tracking. This need includes even the smallest, but very important details, e.g. vocabulary and semantics for public campaign that the fund is planning to run. ",source1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Venture capital historically in Ukraine has very commercial focus. 1991 Accelerator as the elect board member of Ukrainian Venture Capital Association has a lot of observations, as these indicators went even lower with the war at the gate. There's no expertise in the country about creating impact frameworks such as outcome-based investment fund. Even though we've created a full fund's structure for 1991 in the UK with an impactful mission, the fund is still lacking the entire framework of SDG focus and outcome-based investing.","The project will help to design and launch 1991 Ventures London-based $20M seed venture outcome fund which invests in mission-driven Ukrainian founders. The fund builds on the legacy of donor-funded 1991 Accelerator in Ukraine, but will add up with impact-focused frameworks embedded into the design of the fund itself and all future 1991 acceleration programs. 1991 Ventures will build on the existing brand of 1991 and will take leadership in the region to demonstrate the importance and viability of impact focus for venture capital and startups. Developed frameworks will help to shape the focus of donor-funded programs that usually launch 30+ new startups a year. With over 200 alumni startup and $10M+ of attracted funding within 5 years, we expect similar performance and results of this intervention.",Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,,8,,,,source1,,,,,,No,No,Yes,No,source1,,Data for this pipeline project was last updated in August 2023,Ukrain,UA

In Armenia, more than 110,000 people are officially registered as living with diabetes mellitus (DM) - a threefold increase in just 30 years and their number is expected to surpass 150,000 before 2030. According to global estimates by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), almost one in two adults (20-79 years old) with DM are unaware of their diabetes status (2021). For Armenia, the proportion of people with undiagnosed diabetes was estimated at 39.6%1 in 2021, indicating that the actual number of people living with diabetes is much higher than official statistics.","The proposed intervention encompasses a comprehensive approach targeting PWD within the selected regions. The intervention will target the entire DM population in these areas for screening sessions, in parallel
to identifying individuals aged between 40 and 56 who are not yet registered. The intervention is planned to be carried out in two regions of Armenia - Lori and Armavir, for a target group of 16, 979 people. Out of those 14,930 are diagnosed with DM and 2,049 are non-diagnosed people in working age. The latter is also important, since the analysis of newly diagnosed patients for T2DM reveals that the average age of diagnosis is largely skewed compared to average age of diagnosis in the world. In particular, as per 2020 data the average age at diagnosis in Lori is 58 years old and in Armavir 55 years old, which is 10 years later than international literature suggests.
